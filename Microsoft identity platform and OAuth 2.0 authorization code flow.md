# Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
The OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type, or auth code flow, enables a client application to obtain authorized access to protected resources like web APIs. The auth code flow requires a user-agent that supports redirection from the authorization server (the Microsoft identity platform) back to your application. For example, a web browser, desktop, or mobile application operated by a user to sign in to your app and access their data.

## Applications that support the auth code flow
* Single-page web application (SPA)
* Standard (server-based) web application
* Desktop and mobile apps
